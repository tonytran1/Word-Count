*   Word Count
*   @author Tony Tran
*
*   This program reads UTF-8 text files from multiple directories and
*   prints out the most frequently used words.
*
*   # Two Main Cases:
*   If the path is a file then process the file normally.
*   If the path is a directory: all files within that directory, including files
*   within subdirectories will be processed.
*
*   This program was tested and compiled using Java 8.
*
*   This program has a minimum of two arguments to run.
*   The first argument is the requested number of words to be printed out.
*
*   The next argument, and any other arbritary number of arguments following the first,
*   are the directories or file names of where the user wants the program to read.
*
*   Each word will be printed out along with the number of times the values showed up
*   from highest to lowest.
*
*   # Instructions:
*
*   Compile the program:
*   ```
*   javac WordCount.java
*   ```
*
*   Run the program with the directories or filenames - ie:
*   ```
*   java WordCount 5 /test/ /test-two/new.txt
*   ```
